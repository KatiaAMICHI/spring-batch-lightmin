=== In Memory Support

If there is no reason to persist the _Lightmin Configurations_ or the _Batch Job Meta Informations_,
the _SpringBatchLightmin_ also provides _Map_ - implementations for the repositories.

==== Properties

In order to use the _Map_-implementations, the following properties have to be set. 

[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  batch:
    lightmin:
      #default jdbc
      batch-repository-type: map
      #default jdbc
      lightmin-repository-type: map
